## Introduction

The **Pandemic and Epidemic Influenza Severity Assessment (PISA)** application provides users with outputs of influenza severity assessments provided by participating countries. This user guide is intended to provide a summary of features. The guide is divided into the following parts:

- review of the single-page app tabs

- summary of user inputs

- global map

- heatmap

## The Single-page App

The PISA app uses the R Shiny framework of a single-page application. Rather than having separate tabs on separate pages, the app contains all sections including the static material. This differs from many sites that have different web addresses/pages for different sections. With the PISA app, the user never leaves the page. The App is divided into three areas:

- Home

- Explore Data

- About

### Home Tab

The Home Tab is the landing page for the app and welcomes the user. Any notices or information about the app will be posted to this page.

### Explore Data Tab

The Explore Data Tab leads the user to the actual outputs and  allows an interactive use. The data populating the map and charts come from the FluMart data platform and areuploaded by participating countries. Data represents categorical levels of transmissibility, severity, and impact over time. To that end, the data visualizations exist across three sub-tabs for each indicator. The user inputs centrally control all data across those sub-tabs and data visualizations.


### About Tab

The About Tab has information on PISA itself, the three indicators, the PISA App and contact information.

## User Inputs

The User Inputs define data filters for the data visualizations. The  inputs define time periods, indicator and confidence levels and geographic regions.

The categories for `Levels of Activity` include assessment levels for each of the three indicators: transmissibility, seriousness of disease, and impact.


The `Confidence Levels` filter includes the confidence level in each assessment.

Time period (one week) is selected using the week slider for the global map and with the entry of a start year-week end year-week for the heat map.

The `Region` filter includes geographic WHO regions.

Changes to any User input will trigger a chart update

## Global Map

The global map displays by color the indicator’s categorical level for a given week which is selected in the week slider. The legend in the upper right corner provides  the color coding for each indicator’s level of activity.

Users may zoom in by clicking on any country and zoom out by clicking the country a second time. A tool tip, which contains comments on that week’s assessment, will appear when the user hovers the mouse over a country.

The map uses a Wagner Projection that attempts to represent equatorial geographies in more correct proportion to non-equatorial geographies. The latitudinal-longitudinal lines should help orient the user to the relative size. Given the complexity of the projection, the scale legend represents an estimated distance.

## Heat Map

The heat map displays the measure’s cateogrical level of activity by color for all weeks in the selected time period. A tooltip will appear when the user hovers over a tile and the week of interest will be highlighted above the tile.

#### Interaction with Global Map

In addition to the click-zoom of the global map, the click-zoom feature can also filter the heat map to that country of interest. If there is no data for that country, no filter is applied to the heat map.
